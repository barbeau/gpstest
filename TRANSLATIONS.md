## Transifex

We use Transifex, which is free for open-source projects:
* [GPSTest Dashboard](https://www.transifex.com/sean-barbeau/gpstest-android/dashboard/)

[Here](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started-1/translators) are some instructions for getting started with Transifex.  Please note that if you contribute a translation, you will be expected to keep it up-to-date as the app changes.

As mentioned [here](https://docs.transifex.com/faq/all#what-kind-of-notifications-can-i-get-for-the-projects-i-translate), you can register to receive notifications when strings change and are ready for translation:

>To watch a project, select it from your dashboard and click the Watch icon in the header, above the Translate or Live button.

See also the [Notifications documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/tracking/notifications).

After you finish a new language translation, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/barbeau/gpstest/issues/new) asking for it to be merged into the app!
